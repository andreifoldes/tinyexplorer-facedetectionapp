This manual will help you navigate the graphical user interface (GUI) and make the most of our face detection software. Platform Support \u00b6 macOS : \u2705 Fully supported (Intel and Apple Silicon) Windows : \ud83d\udea7 Work in progress Linux : \ud83d\udea7 Work in progress Installation \u00b6 macOS Requirements \u00b6 Before installing the Face Detection App on macOS, ensure your system meets these requirements: macOS Version : macOS 10.15 (Catalina) or later Processor : Intel x64 or Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3) Memory : Minimum 8GB RAM (16GB recommended for video processing) Storage : At least 2GB free disk space for the application and models Installing on macOS \u00b6 To install the Face Detection App on your Mac: Download the Application Visit our GitHub releases page Download the .dmg file for your Mac architecture: TinyExplorer-FaceDetectionApp-mac-x64.dmg for Intel Macs TinyExplorer-FaceDetectionApp-mac-arm64.dmg for Apple Silicon Macs (M1/M2/M3) Install the Application Double-click the downloaded .dmg file to mount it Drag the \"TinyExplorer FaceDetectionApp\" from the mounted disk image to your Applications folder Eject the disk image when copying is complete Remove macOS Quarantine (Required) Why is this necessary? macOS applies a \"quarantine\" attribute to applications downloaded from the internet as a security measure. This prevents unsigned or unnotarized applications from running and protects users from potentially malicious software. Since our Face Detection App is not signed with an Apple Developer certificate, macOS will block it from launching. Using Terminal to unquarantine the app: The most reliable method is using the command line. This works consistently across all macOS versions and immediately removes the quarantine attribute. Open Terminal (Applications \u2192 Utilities \u2192 Terminal) Copy and paste this command: bash xattr -cr \"/Applications/TinyExplorer FaceDetectionApp.app\" Press Enter to execute the command The app is now unquarantined and ready to launch What this command does: - xattr - Extended attributes command - -c - Clear all extended attributes - -r - Recursively apply to all files in the app bundle - The path points to your installed application Alternative methods (if you prefer not using Terminal): - Right-click method : Right-click the app \u2192 \"Open\" \u2192 confirm in warning dialog - System Settings : Launch app (blocked) \u2192 System Settings \u2192 Privacy & Security \u2192 \"Open Anyway\" Note: The command line method is preferred because it's faster, more reliable, and works the same way across all macOS versions. Verify Installation The app should now launch without security warnings You'll see the main Face Detection App interface The Python environment will initialize on first launch (this may take 30-60 seconds) Launching the Application \u00b6 To start the Face Detection App on macOS: Open Finder and navigate to your Applications folder Locate TinyExplorer FaceDetectionApp Double-click the app icon to launch The application will initialize the Python environment on first launch (this may take a few moments) The main interface will appear, ready for use Quick Launch Tips \u00b6 Spotlight Search : Press Cmd + Space and type \"TinyExplorer\" to quickly find and launch the app Dock : Drag the app from Applications to your Dock for one-click access Launchpad : Find the app in Launchpad for touch-friendly launching Interface Overview \u00b6 The Face Detection App user interface on macOS The main interface consists of several key areas: File/Folder Selection : Choose images or videos for processing Click \"Browse File\" to select individual images/videos Click \"Browse Folder\" for batch processing Model Selection : Pick the face detection model to use YOLO models (fast, general-purpose) RetinaFace (accurate, better for challenging conditions) Confidence Threshold : Adjust the detection sensitivity (0.0 - 1.0) Lower values detect more faces but may include false positives Higher values are more selective Output Settings : Configure where results are saved Choose output folder location Results include detected faces and CSV reports Start Button : Begin the detection process Real-time progress updates during processing Cancel option available during long operations Results Display : View the output of the detection process Summary statistics \"Open Results Folder\" for quick access macOS-Specific Features \u00b6 System Integration \u00b6 The Face Detection App integrates seamlessly with macOS: Native file dialogs using macOS Finder Menu bar with standard Mac keyboard shortcuts Notification Center support for completion alerts Dark Mode support (follows system preferences) Performance on Apple Silicon \u00b6 For M1/M2/M3 Mac users: - The app runs natively on Apple Silicon - Optimized Python environments for ARM64 architecture - Metal Performance Shaders acceleration for compatible models Troubleshooting macOS Issues \u00b6 If you encounter issues on macOS: \"App is damaged and can't be opened\" Open Terminal and run: xattr -cr /Applications/TinyExplorer\\ FaceDetectionApp.app Python environment not loading Ensure you have sufficient disk space Try reinstalling the application Slow performance on older Macs Reduce batch size for folder processing Use lighter models (YOLOv8n instead of YOLOv8l) Next Steps \u00b6 Now that you have the Face Detection App installed and running on macOS: Try a sample image : Test with a single photo to familiarize yourself with the interface Explore model options : Compare different models to find the best balance of speed and accuracy Process a folder : Try batch processing for efficient workflow Check the results : Review the CSV output and detected face images For detailed usage instructions, see our User Guide .
