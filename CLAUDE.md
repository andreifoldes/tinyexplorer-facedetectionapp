# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

# Important
Always use Playwright MCP tools to check the app is rendering before asking me to look.

## Project Overview

This is an Electron application that integrates Python Flask backend with a React frontend. The app spawns a Python Flask server that provides both GraphQL endpoints and WebSocket communication for real-time face recognition processing using YOLO models.

## Key Architecture Components

### Electron Main Process (`main/`)
- `main/index.ts`: Main Electron process that creates the window, handles IPC communication, manages tray functionality, and implements file/folder dialogs
- `main/with-python-subprocess.ts`: Critical component that manages Python subprocess lifecycle using stdin/stdout JSON communication, handles cross-platform Python execution, and manages graceful shutdown

### Python Backend (`python/`)
- `python/subprocess_api.py`: Main subprocess API that handles JSON commands via stdin/stdout communication
- `python/launcher.py`: Launcher script that sets up bundled dependencies for packaged builds (legacy single-environment)
- `python/multi_env_launcher.py`: **Multi-environment launcher that dynamically switches between YOLO and RetinaFace environments**
- `python/face_detection.py`: Advanced face detection processor supporting both YOLO and RetinaFace models with real-time progress callbacks
- `python/calc.py`: Simple calculator module for testing subprocess communication
- Communication via JSON messages over stdin/stdout (no HTTP server required)
- Commands: `get_models`, `load_model`, `start_processing`, `stop_processing`, `get_results`, `export_csv`

### React Frontend (`src/`)
- `src/App.tsx`: Main React component that communicates with Python subprocess via Electron IPC
- Direct IPC communication: No HTTP/WebSocket overhead, all communication through Electron's IPC system
- Features: File/folder selection, model selection, confidence threshold adjustment, real-time progress tracking
- Supports both single file and batch folder processing, handles image and video files

```

## Testing and Validation Workflow

After each modification to the codebase:

1. **Rebuild the application**: `npm run build`
2. **Test the macOS x64 application**: The built app is located at `dist/mac/TinyExplorer FaceDetectionApp.app`
3. **Verify core functionality**: 
   - Launch the packaged app
   - Test file/folder selection
   - Verify Python subprocess communication
   - Run face detection on sample images
   - Confirm results export functionality

## Python Environment Setup

The project uses a **dual environment architecture** to handle conflicting dependencies between YOLO and RetinaFace models:

### Development Environment (Single Environment)
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate electron-python-sample
```

### Packaged Application (Dual Environment)
The packaged application uses two separate Python environments to avoid dependency conflicts:

#### YOLO Environment (`pythondist/yolo-env/`)
- **Purpose**: Handles YOLO-based face detection models
- **Key Dependencies**: ultralytics, torch, torchvision, opencv-python
- **Models Supported**: yolov8n-face.pt, yolov8m-face.pt, yolov8l-face.pt, yolov11m-face.pt, yolov11l-face.pt, yolov12l-face.pt
- **Python Version**: 3.10 (for optimal PyTorch compatibility)

#### RetinaFace Environment (`pythondist/retinaface-env/`)
- **Purpose**: Handles RetinaFace model processing  
- **Key Dependencies**: tensorflow, tf-keras, retina-face, opencv-python, pillow
- **Models Supported**: RetinaFace (pre-trained model)
- **Python Version**: 3.10 (for TensorFlow 2.19+ compatibility)

### Environment Switching Mechanism
- **Launcher**: `python/multi_env_launcher.py` detects model type via `MODEL_TYPE` environment variable
- **Detection Logic**: 
  - `MODEL_TYPE=yolo` ‚Üí loads YOLO environment with PyTorch dependencies
  - `MODEL_TYPE=retinaface` ‚Üí loads RetinaFace environment with TensorFlow dependencies
- **Dynamic Switching**: Electron main process restarts Python subprocess when switching between YOLO and RetinaFace models
- **Isolation**: Each environment has completely isolated dependencies to prevent version conflicts

### Why Dual Environments?
- **TensorFlow vs PyTorch**: RetinaFace requires TensorFlow while YOLO models use PyTorch
- **Python Version Requirements**: TensorFlow 2.19+ requires Python 3.10, conflicting with some PyTorch installations
- **Dependency Conflicts**: numpy, pillow, and OpenCV versions often conflict between ML frameworks
- **Package Size**: Bundling both frameworks in one environment creates unnecessarily large distributions

## Remote Display Configuration

For remote development (SSH with X11 forwarding), configure `.env` file:

```bash
# .env
BROWSER=none
DISPLAY=your.remote.host:0.0
```

The Playwright configuration automatically detects `DISPLAY` environment variable and:
- Enables headed mode when `DISPLAY` is set
- Adds Chrome args for X11 forwarding compatibility (`--no-sandbox`, `--disable-dev-shm-usage`)
- Enables remote debugging on port 9222

This allows GUI testing and Electron development over SSH connections with X11 forwarding (e.g., MobaXterm, X11 forwarding).

## Build Process and Packaging

1. `npm run python-build` - Bundles Python dependencies into dual environments:
   - Creates `pythondist/yolo-env/` with PyTorch-based YOLO dependencies
   - Creates `pythondist/retinaface-env/` with TensorFlow-based RetinaFace dependencies
   - Copies Python source files to `pythondist/python/` including `multi_env_launcher.py`
   - Script: `scripts/bundle-python.js`
2. `npm run react-build` - Builds React app with legacy OpenSSL support
3. `npm run main-build` - Compiles TypeScript and creates Electron package
4. Python bundling creates optimized environment subsets to reduce distribution size while maintaining dependency isolation

## Testing

- Uses Playwright for GUI testing with custom configuration
- Test files in `tests/` directory (`gui-components.spec.js`, `served-gui-test.spec.js`, `mcp-debug-test.spec.js`)
- `npm run test:gui` for headless testing, `npm run test:gui:headed` for headed mode
- Tests include app loading, UI components, Python subprocess communication, and face detection functionality
- Additional Python standalone tests: `test_subprocess.py`, `test_both_models.py`, `test_compatibility.py`
- Playwright config automatically detects X11 forwarding for remote development

## Communication Architecture

### IPC-based Communication (No HTTP Server)
- **Electron IPC**: Primary communication between React frontend and Electron main process
- **Subprocess stdin/stdout**: JSON message communication between Electron and Python subprocess
- **Real-time Events**: Python sends progress events via stdout, forwarded to React via IPC
- No authentication required - communication is process-local and secure by design

### Subprocess Command Flow
1. React sends commands to main process via `ipcRenderer.send("python-command", command)`
2. Main process forwards commands to Python subprocess via stdin JSON
3. Python subprocess processes commands and sends responses via stdout JSON
4. Main process forwards responses back to React via `ipcRenderer.on("python-response")`
5. Progress events are emitted separately via `ipcRenderer.on("python-event")`

### Face Recognition Pipeline
1. User selects files/folders through Electron file dialogs (`browse-folder`, `browse-file` IPC)
2. User selects results output folder
3. IPC sends `start_processing` command to Python subprocess with parameters
4. Python processes images/videos with selected model (YOLO or RetinaFace)
5. Real-time progress events sent via stdout, forwarded to React via `python-event` IPC
6. UI updates progress bar and displays real-time progress messages
7. Completion events trigger final results display and enable "Open Results Folder" button

## Important Implementation Details

### Python Process Management
- Python process lifecycle managed by `main/with-python-subprocess.ts` with different handling for packaged vs. unpackaged scenarios
- Uses `__dirname.indexOf("app.asar")` to detect if running from packaged app
- **Multi-environment support**: Automatically detects and switches between YOLO and RetinaFace environments based on model selection
- Python subprocess exits gracefully via `exit` command when Electron shuts down
- Environment switching triggers subprocess restart with appropriate `MODEL_TYPE` environment variable

### Model Support and Processing
- Face recognition supports multiple YOLO models (yolov8n-face, yolov8l-face, etc.) and RetinaFace with configurable confidence thresholds
- **YOLO Models**: Confidence typically 0.5-0.7, optimized for speed and general face detection
- **RetinaFace**: Confidence 0.9, optimized for accuracy and works better with challenging lighting/angles
- Models are automatically downloaded from GitHub releases on first use if not found locally
- **Environment-specific model loading**: YOLO models load in PyTorch environment, RetinaFace loads in TensorFlow environment

### User Experience Features
- Progress events include emoji symbols for better UX (üñºÔ∏è for images, üé¨ for videos, ‚úÖ for success, etc.)
- **Automatic model optimization**: App intelligently suggests better face models based on processing requirements
- Real-time environment switching feedback via console messages
- Cross-platform Python executable detection (handles different Python binary names)
- Tray functionality with show/hide/quit options
- System file manager integration for opening results folders

### Technical Architecture
- Python bundling script creates optimized distribution with essential packages only, separated by environment
- **Dependency isolation**: Complete separation of PyTorch and TensorFlow dependencies prevents version conflicts
- **Graceful fallback**: If environment switching fails, app maintains functionality with current environment
- **Memory efficiency**: Only loads required dependencies for the selected model type
